   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Step 1: Create a class\n",
    "In Python, all classes start with the keyword class followed by a class name. The naming convention for classes is to use CamelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Customer:\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        a single customer that moves through the supermarket\n",
    "        in a MCMC simulation\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to describe what the class does in a docstring right after the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three dots are a placeholder. We will add an indented block of code later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Instantiate the class\n",
    "To use a class, we will need to create at least one object from it. Add the following line after the class definition (unindented):\n",
    "\n",
    "    cust1 = Customer()\n",
    "    A Python class is used like a function that creates objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced programmers will probably not like that description a lot, but in Python it is technically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Write a constructor\n",
    "Most classes have a constructor, a special method with the name __init__(). In the constructor we define the attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following as an indented block below the class definition (replacing the ...):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, state, budget=100):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.state = state\n",
    "        self.budget = budget\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes are created by assigning to self.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is called automatically when you instantiate a class. You need to provide values for all non-default parameters except self, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cust1 = Customer(\"Jake\", \"drinks\", 50)\n",
    "    cust2 = Customer(\"Margaret\", \"spices\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Access attributes\n",
    "You can access (and modify) all attributes of an object via the dot syntax. Note that different objects have their own attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(cust1.name, cust1.state)\n",
    "    print(cust2.name, cust2.budget)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Include a __repr__() method\n",
    "The method __repr__() is called whenever an object is converted to a string (e.g. by print). You can use it to create a summary of the object. This is very useful for debugging, so __repr__() is usually one of the first methods you should implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method should return a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f'<Customer {self.name} in {self.state}>'\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the output of print(cust1) before and after adding __repr__()\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint Never call methods starting with underscores directly. Usually something else triggers them.\n",
    "Step 6: Add a method\n",
    "Finally, add a method that changes the state attribute of the customer. Add another method in the class block:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def next_state(self):\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        Propagates the customer to the next state.\n",
    "        Returns nothing.\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        self.state = random.choice(['spices', 'drinks', 'fruit'])\n",
    "    and call the method with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cust1.next_state()\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that methods work like functions in most aspects: they can have multiple parameters and a return value (this method has neither).\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is that a method has the self parameter that allows you to access the attributes of an object."
