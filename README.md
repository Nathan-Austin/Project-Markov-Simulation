# Supermarket customer movement simulator
Supermarket simulator project collab with Emile Reynaud
Spiced Academy week 8 project.
In this project we learned to work as a team and collaborate on git. Emily introduced github desktop which was exciting to learn and make some mistakes with. 
The aim is to use time series data of customer movement through a market and to then model and predict where customers are likely to go next.
This infomation can then be used for business development, marketing strategies and product placement.

Breif: Analyze existing customer data, generate prediction model and then if possible, visualize new customer shopping behaviour.
