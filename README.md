# Project-Markov-Simulation
Spiced Academy week 8 project collab with Emile Reynaud


In this project, we wrote a program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket.

The project involves the following tasks:

1: Explore the data (includes pandas wrangling)

2: Calculate transition probabilities (a 5x5 matrix)

3: Implement a customer class

4: Run a MCMC simulation for a single customer

5: Extend the simulation to multiple customers
